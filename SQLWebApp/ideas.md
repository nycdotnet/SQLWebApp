* enhancement: optionally restrict connection to source IP address
* provide a way to start the SQL Server service
* keyboard shortcuts
* support SQL Azure and Integrated Windows authentication
* provide a way to close the connection

goals:
* improved UI with syntax highlighting
* OWIN - make this a command-line app you can just start on a port with no install needed.
